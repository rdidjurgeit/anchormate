Required 
Python and Node to be install

after creating the first model i use the commands 

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

so the migrate was made

after installing react since some packages are open sorce there is vunerable at this moment it was found 

8 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 6 high). using the command:

npm audit fix

did not fix and the other option wil be:

npm audit fix --force

but this could make braking changes and at this moment there is no possibility to checke it.


pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt
npm install react-icons
